# GitButler Alpha Issue Tracker

This is a (temporary) space for alpha users of [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com)'s desktop application.

**Bugs, feature requests, and general feedback are all permitted and encouraged!** We just ask that you
search the issues first to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported!

If you'd like to communicate more interactively with the GitButler [team](https://github.com/orgs/gitbutlerapp/people)
feel free to join us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQS49BM9Jx).
